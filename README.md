<h1 align="center"><strong>A boilerplate for a custom user management layer around firebase authentication</strong></h1>

<br />

## Configuration:

* Do make sure to not put your personal `.env` file under version control. Run `git rm -r --cached .` `git add .
` and commit to make sure it is removed from your repository clone. 
* Configure the prisma endpoint in your `.env` file to map to your workspace of else have it point to a custom prisma instance. 
* If running in production, supply your firebase credentials through the env variables `FIREBASE_CREDS_URL` and `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`. For local development, put your firebase credentials in a file called `firebase-creds.json` at the root level. 


## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `typescript-basic` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate typescript-basic

# 2. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
